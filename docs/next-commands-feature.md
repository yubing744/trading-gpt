# Next-Cycle Command Persistence Feature

## Overview

The Next-Cycle Command Persistence feature enables trading strategies to schedule commands for execution in the next decision cycle. This allows the AI to proactively collect indicator data, execute workflows, or perform auxiliary tasks before making the next trading decision.

## Key Benefits

- **Proactive Data Collection**: Schedule indicator collection commands instead of relying on manual configuration
- **Workflow Integration**: Execute external workflows (e.g., Coze sentiment analysis) as part of decision flow
- **Persistence**: Commands survive strategy restarts and are automatically retried on failure
- **Validation**: Commands are validated against entity capabilities before execution

## How It Works

### Architecture

```
Decision Cycle N:
  AI outputs Result with next_commands
  ‚Üí Commands saved to memory-bank/commands.json

Decision Cycle N+1:
  Load pending commands from file
  ‚Üí Execute each command via entity.HandleCommand()
  ‚Üí Results emitted as events/indicators
  ‚Üí AI makes decision with full context (market data + command results)
```

### Command Flow

1. **AI Schedules Commands**: During decision cycle N, AI outputs `next_commands` in JSON response
2. **Persistence**: Commands are saved to `memory-bank/commands.json` with status tracking
3. **Pre-Execution**: At the start of cycle N+1, pending commands are loaded and executed
4. **Result Integration**: Command results are available as events/indicators for AI analysis
5. **Status Update**: Completed/failed commands are archived for audit

## Usage

### AI Output Format

The AI can include `next_commands` in its JSON response:

```json
{
  "thoughts": {
    "plan": "...",
    "analyze": "...",
    "detail": "...",
    "reflection": "...",
    "speak": "..."
  },
  "action": {
    "name": "exchange.hold_position",
    "args": {}
  },
  "next_commands": [
    {
      "entity_id": "coze",
      "command_name": "market_sentiment_workflow",
      "args": {
        "workflow_id": "123456",
        "symbol": "BTCUSDT"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### How AI Determines entity_id

**Command Format in Prompt:**
All available commands are presented to the AI in the format `"entity_id.command_name"`, for example:
- `exchange.open_long_position`
- `coze.workflow_sentiment`
- `fng.refresh_index`
- `twitterapi.search_tweets`

**Extraction Process:**
The AI needs to split the command name at the dot (`.`) to determine:
1. **entity_id**: The part before the dot (e.g., `"exchange"`, `"coze"`, `"fng"`, `"twitterapi"`)
2. **command_name**: The part after the dot (e.g., `"open_long_position"`, `"refresh_index"`)

**Available Entities:**
- **exchange**: Trading operations
- **coze**: Coze workflow/bot execution
- **fng**: Fear & Greed Index data
- **twitterapi**: Twitter search functionality

**Examples:**
- `"exchange.open_long_position"` ‚Üí `entity_id="exchange"`, `command_name="open_long_position"`
- `"fng.get_historical_index"` ‚Üí `entity_id="fng"`, `command_name="get_historical_index"`
- `"twitterapi.search_tweets"` ‚Üí `entity_id="twitterapi"`, `command_name="search_tweets"`

This information is clearly explained in the AI's prompt to ensure correct command scheduling.

### Command Structure

Each command in `next_commands` must include:

- **entity_id**: Target entity (e.g., "coze", "exchange")
- **command_name**: Command name matching entity's `Actions()` descriptor
- **args**: Map of string parameters required by the command

### Entity Command Declaration

All entities declare their available commands via the `Actions()` method. Here are examples from each entity:

**Coze Entity:**
```go
func (e *CozeEntity) Actions() []*types.ActionDesc {
    return []*types.ActionDesc{
        {
            Name:        "market_sentiment_workflow",
            Description: "Analyze market sentiment from social media",
            Args: []types.ArgmentDesc{
                {Name: "workflow_id", Description: "Coze workflow ID"},
                {Name: "symbol", Description: "Trading pair symbol"},
            },
        },
    }
}
```

**FNG Entity:**
```go
func (entity *FearAndGreedEntity) Actions() []*types.ActionDesc {
    return []*types.ActionDesc{
        {
            Name:        "refresh_index",
            Description: "Manually refresh the current Fear & Greed Index",
        },
        {
            Name:        "get_historical_index",
            Description: "Get historical Fear & Greed Index data",
            Args: []types.ArgmentDesc{
                {Name: "limit", Description: "Number of historical data points (default: 7, max: 30)"},
            },
        },
    }
}
```

**TwitterAPI Entity:**
```go
func (e *TwitterAPIEntity) Actions() []*types.ActionDesc {
    return []*types.ActionDesc{
        {
            Name:        "search_tweets",
            Description: "Search Twitter for tweets matching a query",
            Args: []types.ArgmentDesc{
                {Name: "query", Description: "Search query (required)"},
                {Name: "query_type", Description: "Query type: Top|Latest (default: Top)"},
                {Name: "max_results", Description: "Maximum results (default: 10, max: 100)"},
            },
        },
    }
}
```

**Exchange Entity:**
The Exchange entity already has comprehensive command support for trading operations like `open_long_position`, `open_short_position`, `close_position`, `update_position`, etc.

## Configuration

### Enable Command System

Add to `bbgo.yaml`:

```yaml
exchangeStrategies:
- on: okex
  jarvis:
    # ... existing config ...

    commands:
      enabled: true
      command_path: "memory-bank/commands.json"  # optional, default shown
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | bool | false | Enable/disable command system |
| `command_path` | string | `memory-bank/commands.json` | Path to command persistence file |

## File Format

Commands are persisted in JSON format:

```json
{
  "pending": [
    {
      "id": "uuid-1",
      "entity_id": "coze",
      "command_name": "market_sentiment_workflow",
      "args": {
        "workflow_id": "123456",
        "symbol": "BTCUSDT"
      },
      "status": "pending",
      "retry_count": 0,
      "max_retries": 1,
      "created_at": "2025-01-23T10:00:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2025-01-23T10:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "completed": [],
  "failed": []
}
```

## Error Handling

### Command Validation

Before executing, commands are validated:

1. **Entity Exists**: Checks if target entity is registered
2. **Command Supported**: Verifies command is in entity's `Actions()` list

Invalid commands are skipped with a warning message.

### Execution Errors

- **Timeout**: Commands have a 30-second execution timeout
- **Retry Logic**: Failed commands are retried once (configurable via `max_retries`)
- **Permanent Failure**: After max retries, commands are moved to `failed` list

### Status Transitions

```
pending ‚Üí (execute) ‚Üí completed
        ‚Üì (error)
        failed ‚Üí (retry) ‚Üí completed
              ‚Üì (max retries)
              permanently failed (archived)
```

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

1. **`pkg/types/result.go`**: Extended with `NextCommand` type
2. **`pkg/memory/command_memory.go`**: Command persistence manager
3. **`pkg/config/config.go`**: Configuration structures
4. **`pkg/jarvis.go`**: Command execution orchestration
5. **`pkg/env/environment.go`**: Entity management and command routing

### Execution Timeline

```
14:00:00 - Cycle N completes, AI outputs next_commands
14:00:01 - Commands saved to commands.json
...
14:15:00 - Cycle N+1 starts
14:15:01 - Load pending commands (2 commands found)
14:15:02 - Execute command 1: coze.market_sentiment
14:15:05 - Command 1 completed successfully
14:15:06 - Execute command 2: coze.on_chain_metrics
14:15:09 - Command 2 completed successfully
14:15:10 - Collect market data (kline, indicators, position)
14:15:11 - Send all data (market + command results) to AI
14:15:15 - AI makes decision based on complete context
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Log Messages

The system provides detailed logging:

- **Command Scheduling**: `üìù Scheduling N commands for next cycle...`
- **Command Execution**: `üìã Executing N pending commands...`
- **Success**: `‚úÖ Command executed successfully: entity.command`
- **Failure**: `‚ùå Command failed permanently: entity.command - error`
- **Validation**: `‚ö†Ô∏è Skipping command: 'command' not supported by entity 'entity_id'`

### Checking Command Status

View the command file directly:

```bash
cat memory-bank/commands.json | jq
```

### Testing Command Execution

Test entity commands manually:

```go
// In Go code or test
entity := world.GetEntity("coze")
err := entity.HandleCommand(ctx, "market_sentiment", map[string]string{
    "workflow_id": "123456",
    "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
})
```

## Limitations

1. **Sequential Execution**: Commands execute one at a time (future: parallel execution)
2. **String Parameters Only**: All command arguments must be strings
3. **No Scheduling Priority**: Commands execute in the order they appear
4. **Single Instance**: Assumes single Jarvis instance (no distributed coordination)

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Commands Simple**: Each command should be focused and fast (< 30s)
2. **Validate Entity Support**: Check entity `Actions()` before scheduling
3. **Provide Fallbacks**: AI should handle cases where commands fail
4. **Monitor Failures**: Regularly review failed commands in logs
5. **Limit Command Count**: Avoid scheduling too many commands per cycle (impacts latency)

## Troubleshooting

### Commands Not Executing

- Check `commands.enabled: true` in config
- Verify entity is registered and running
- Check logs for validation errors

### Commands Timing Out

- Reduce workflow complexity
- Increase timeout in code (default: 30s)
- Check external API performance

### Commands Failing Validation

- Verify command name matches entity's `Actions()`
- Check entity ID is correct
- Review entity implementation of `Actions()`

## Future Enhancements

- Parallel command execution
- Command priority and scheduling
- Database-backed persistence
- UI for command status monitoring
- Command execution metrics
- Advanced retry strategies (exponential backoff)

### Code Review Fixes (PR #65) - 2025-11-01
Addressed all critical issues from PR #65 code review with 5 major fixes:

1. **Duplicate Indicator Detection** (High Priority)
   - Check pre-configured indicators before creating new ones
   - Match by type, interval, window_size, and band_width
   - Reuse existing indicators to avoid resource waste
   - Prevents data inconsistency and memory bloat

2. **Enhanced Parameter Validation** (Medium Priority)
   - Strict validation for window_size and band_width
   - Verify positive values and valid ranges
   - Type whitelist validation for security
   - Clear error messages for AI troubleshooting

3. **Data Sufficiency Check** (Medium Priority)
   - Verify sufficient kline data before calculation
   - Prevents crashes from insufficient historical data
   - Critical for new trading pairs with limited history

4. **Frequency Limiting** (Medium Priority)
   - Limit to 5 dynamic indicator requests per 15-minute cycle
   - Auto-reset counter each cycle
   - Prevents resource exhaustion from excessive requests

5. **Custom Name Support** (User Request)
   - Optional `name` parameter for AI to specify indicator names
   - Auto-generated names include all parameters: "rsi_5m_w14_dynamic"
   - Improves debugging and prevents naming conflicts

### Thread Safety Improvements (PR #65) - 2025-11-01
- **FearAndGreedEntity**: Added thread-safe event channel using `atomic.Value`
- **TwitterAPIEntity**: Added thread-safe event channel using `atomic.Value`
- **ExchangeEntity**: Added thread-safe event channel using `atomic.Value`
- **Command count limits**: Added `MaxCommandsPerCycle = 10` to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Context cancellation**: Added proper context checking in command execution loops
- **File permissions**: Restricted to 0600/0700 for enhanced security
- **Integer parsing**: Replaced `fmt.Sscanf` with `strconv.Atoi` for consistency

### Limit Order Feature (Issue #58) - 2025-01-22
- **Implemented limit order support** with price expression parsing
- **Added automatic cleanup mechanism** - unfilled limit orders are canceled at each decision cycle
- **Created price expression parser** (`pkg/utils/price.go`) supporting variables like `last_close`, `last_high`, etc.
- **Extended trading commands** with 4 new parameters: order_type, limit_price, time_in_force, post_only
- **Comprehensive testing** - 9 unit tests all passing
- **Developer documentation** - Created `docs/limit-order-feature.md` with usage guide and technical details
- **Key design decision**: Auto-cleanup approach keeps AI decision-making simple while preventing order accumulation

### Memory System Implementation (Issue #40)
- **Successfully implemented file-based memory system** for trading-gpt
- Extended `pkg/types/result.go` to include Memory field in Result structure
- Modified `pkg/prompt/prompt.go` to integrate memory prompts with conditional rendering and cycle reset information
- Added memory configuration in `pkg/config/config.go` with MemoryConfig struct
- **Created independent memory package** `pkg/memory/memory_manager.go` for better code organization
- Integrated memory functionality into `pkg/jarvis.go` using the independent memory package
- Implemented word limit enforcement with AI feedback for memory truncation
- **Added strategy cycle reset information** to AI prompts to explain memory behavior
- **Updated all comments to English** for consistency, including `pkg/types/result.go` and `pkg/chat/feishu/feishu_chat_provider.go`
- **Fixed directory creation issue** in `pkg/memory/memory_manager.go` - now automatically creates directories if they don't exist
- **Fixed memory processing logic** in `pkg/jarvis.go` - AI outputs complete memory content, so we now replace instead of merge
- **Fixed memory prompt logic** in `pkg/prompt/prompt.go` - now uses `MemoryEnabled` instead of `.Memory` to control memory prompts, ensuring AI outputs memory even on first run
- **Enhanced memory usage feedback** in `pkg/prompt/prompt.go` - added current word count, usage percentage, and intelligent suggestions to help AI decide whether to expand or consolidate memory
- Created example configuration file `bbgo-memory-example.yaml`
- Created sample memory file `memory-bank/trading-memory.md`
- Updated progress documentation to reflect memory system implementation

## Next Steps
1. **Test dynamic indicator queries** in real trading scenarios with multi-timeframe analysis
2. **Monitor indicator reuse effectiveness** to validate duplicate detection logic
3. **Observe AI indicator parameter choices** to refine default values if needed
4. **Consider adding indicator caching** for frequently requested combinations
5. **Explore parallel command execution** to improve performance
6. **Test frequency limits** under high-load scenarios

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Documentation Approach**: Using structured Markdown files organized in a clear hierarchy to maintain project knowledge.
- **Documentation Scope**: Focus on both technical implementation details and higher-level product/project context.
- **Documentation Maintenance**: Regular updates to keep documentation in sync with implementation.
- **Memory Feature Implementation**: The core logic for reflection and memory management will reside in `pkg/jarvis.go` to maintain central control, interacting with the `Trading Agent` as needed for context or decision execution.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Code Organization**: Modular structure with clear separation of concerns
- **Interface Design**: Clear interfaces for agents, environments, and other components
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling and reporting throughout the system
- **Testing**: Appropriate test coverage for critical components
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration with sensible defaults

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The integration of LLMs with trading systems creates a powerful tool for democratizing algorithmic trading
- Natural language interfaces can significantly reduce the barrier to entry for algorithmic trading
- Careful consideration of risk management is essential for any trading system
- The modular architecture facilitates extension and maintenance
- **Simplicity in AI decision-making is crucial** - Auto-cleanup approach for limit orders prevents AI from needing to manage order state, keeping decision complexity low
- **Expression-based parameters provide flexibility** - Price expressions like "last_close * 0.995" allow dynamic pricing without complex AI logic
- **Cycle-based cleanup aligns with decision patterns** - Periodic cleanup matches the natural rhythm of strategy evaluation cycles
- **Zero-config dynamic queries unlock AI potential** - Removing pre-configuration requirements enables true adaptive strategies
- **Duplicate detection is critical for resource efficiency** - Reusing pre-configured indicators prevents waste and ensures consistency
- **Comprehensive validation prevents silent failures** - Strict parameter checking with clear error messages helps AI learn and adapt
- **Thread safety cannot be assumed** - `atomic.Value` for shared state access prevents race conditions in concurrent environments
- **Frequency limits protect system stability** - Rate limiting prevents resource exhaustion from AI exploration behaviors
